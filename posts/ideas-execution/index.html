            Ideas are cheap. That’s great. Expend just a few calories and after a while, we
            <!-- more -->
            have a lot of them. Executing on them is harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have, well… ideas. Quite a lot of them have been recorded but not a lot have
            been built.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have tried building things in the past but none of them were ever completed
            or felt finished. I hope to change that and that’s where this site comes in.
            With this site, I hope to track my progress in taking some of these ideas to
            reality and to also document my thoughts along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site itself is an idea I had years ago that never quite got the time it
            needed and most importantly the pragmatism it deserved. I intended it to be
            feature-rich like an actual project tracking site. Eventually all that
            complexity made it difficult for me to even get started. Because of it, I built
            a less than half-baked version out of frustration.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to approach things differently now and hopefully a lot more ideas can
            become reality. There are things that I still need to work on like being more
            pragmatic or deciding when a project is done. These are skills I hope to learn
            along the way with more experience.
