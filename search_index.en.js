I needed to add a tool to an open-source project I’m working on, and after some searching on the web, I found one that I could use. But then I learned that the project had been moved to a paid service after being open source for a while. I felt betrayed and unreasonably angry, even though I understood perfectly why the developers chose to do this.\nTo be clear, I don’t hate the developers. I just hate that we have to live like this. Because we as individuals are trapped in this exploitative system, we are forced to do some of these maneuvers to prevent our own exploitation – a perfectly rational response in a hostile environment. However, I feel that while the strategies we employ ensure our individual survival within the hostile system, those inadvertently contribute to the system’s continued existence, thereby perpetuating the very conditions that necessitate those strategies.\nWe play the game, and the game goes on.\n","id":"https://brainchildprojects.com/posts/close-sourcing-as-strategy/","title":"Close Sourcing as Strategy"},"https://brainchildprojects.com/posts/exceptions-are-part-of-the-interface/":{"body":"I think I’ve known this for a long time now but it’s only today that I’ve fully articulated this by myself. A lot of smarter people have talked about this before but it’s only today that I’ve put this idea into words on my own.\nThe reason why I appreciate Go’s “errors as values” approach and the enums in Rust is that in those languages, I tend to write functions/methods that are more explicit in their behavior. I tend to declare this behavior in the interface itself.\nException handling as a strategy adds some cognitive tax to my code.

I hope to change that and that’s where this site comes in.\nWith this site, I hope to track my progress in taking some of these ideas to\nreality and to also document my thoughts along the way.\nThis site itself is an idea I had years ago that never quite got the time it\nneeded and most importantly the pragmatism it deserved. I intended it to be\nfeature-rich like an actual project tracking site. Eventually all that\ncomplexity made it difficult for me to even get started. Because of it, I built\na less than half-baked version out of frustration.\nI hope to approach things differently now and hopefully a lot more ideas can\nbecome reality. There are things that I still need to work on like being more\npragmatic or deciding when a project is done. These are skills I hope to learn\nalong the way with more experience.\nHere’s to making things\nhappen!\n","id":"https://brainchildprojects.com/posts/ideas-execution/","title":"Ideas & Execution"},"https://brainchildprojects.com/posts/refactoring-nitrolinks-part-1-creating-a-gem/":{"body":"I am building Pondo as an experiment on how\nto build a functional, modern web application without necessarily using a large\nfront-end framework (e.g. Angular, Ember, React). The idea is to mostly develop\napplications as one would within the usual semantics of the normal\nRequest-Response cycle. If you’ve used Pjax,\nor Turbolinks then you’re familiar\nwith this.\nAs the name might imply, Nitrolinks was inspired by Turbolinks. In fact, some of\nthe code on the Rails-side is shamelessly stolen from Turbolinks and the events\nfired are named similarly. However, there are two major differences between\nthem. For one, Turbolinks right now only supports GET requests (it will support\nPOST in the future). The other is while Turbolinks replaces the code in the\n&lt;body&gt; element in its entirety, Nitrolinks uses\nset-dom to only update the elements\nthat actually changed. This is similar to how the virtual dom works in React.\nPondo is meant to be an experiment and that is why Nitrolinks lives inside its\ncodebase. However, it does make testing and refactoring Nitrolinks harder. The\nplan is to move the Nitrolinks code to a gem so I can test it separately.\nThe Plan\n\nMove Nitrolinks out into its own gem\nCreate tests within Nitrolinks that mirror tests in Pondo\nRemove Nitrolinks-specific tests out of Pondo\nRewrite Nitrolinks in ES6\n\nToday’s task will only cover #1.\nCreating a Gem\nI haven’t created a ruby gem before so this is going to be a learning experience.\nI am using this tutorial from bundler\nand this guide on creating an asset gem to help me.\nWe need to make sure that Pondo still works even when we remove Nitrolinks.\nLuckily, Pondo has good test coverage. Nitrolinks itself has some tests that\nwere written for it specifically, but we’ll have to leave them on the Pondo\ncodebase for now to make things simpler.\nFirst, we’ll create the gem using bundler:\n\nBundler makes creating gems really easy. Running the previous command creates\nthe files and directories we need to get started. However, we need to clean it\nup a bit. We don’t need the bin and spec directories right now and some other\nfiles. Here’s what it looks now:\n\nRails Engine\nSince we’re using this with Rails, we’ll turn this gem into a\nRails Engine. To do that, let’s\ncreate an Engine class under nitrolinks.\n\nAnd we can require this on the nitrolinks module code itself.\n\nThe next part is just moving the nitrolinks javascript code from Pondo to\nNitrolinks itself. We’re going to match the directory structure here. We’re also\ngoing to need the set-dom library so we’ll place it at the vendor directory.\nHere’s what the directory looks now:\n\nImporting Nitrolinks\nOn Pondo, let’s add nitrolinks-rails as a dependency. We’ll point\nit to our local copy for now for testing.\n\nAfter that, we’ll have to remove Pondo’s copy of nitrolinks code. At this point,\nwe need to make sure that everything works as expected. Luckily, we still have\nour nitrolinks tests on Pondo so this really helps.\n\nGreat!\nA Temporary Duplication\nBetween Pondo app itself and Nitrolinks, they share a common js script I wrote\ncalled pu (for “pondo utilities”, :/ ). Some of them may need to be moved to\nnitrolinks. Let’s tally all the calls we make to pu on the nitrolinks side:\n\npu.getContentOfElement\npu.isCurrentPageReloaded\npu.handleLinkClicks\npu.handleFormSubmits\npu.merge\npu.uuid\n\nThat’s a lot! We’ll need to have them on nitrolinks. To simplify things, we’ll\ncopy all of the pu script for now. We’ll manage this duplication of code later.\nRails Engine Part 2\nNow that we know that the Nitrolinks scripts are working, it’s time to move the\ncontroller-related Nitrolinks code on Pondo to Nitrolinks itself. That way we\nwe’re left with just Pondo code on Pondo.\n\n\nOkay. Is everything still working? Let’s run some tests:\n\nAwesome!\nPublishing the Gem\nNow it’s time to publish our gem to rubygems. First we’ll update our README to\ntalk about what Nitrolinks is and warn people because it’s not yet ready for\nproduction.\n\nThen we commit everything. And add it to our remote repository, which in this\ncase is https://github.com/asartalo/nitrolinks-rails.git\nAnd lastly, run a helpful rake task from Bundler:\n\nAnd we’re done! Now it’s just a matter of testing it out again…\n\nGreen! This ends our first task for refactoring Nitrolinks. The next part is\nfiguring out how to add tests to our gem. That will be a post for another day.\n","id":"https://brainchildprojects.com/posts/refactoring-nitrolinks-part-1-creating-a-gem/","title":"Refactoring Nitrolinks, Part 1: Creating a Gem"},"https://brainchildprojects.com/posts/refactoring-nitrolinks-part-2-tests-for-a-rails-engine/":{"body":"This is Part 2 of a series of posts about refactoring\nNitrolinks\nout of Pondo. Last time we’ve\nsuccessfully moved Nitrolinks out of Pondo\nbut we left most of the Nitrolinks-specific tests on the Pondo source code\nitself. This time we’ll move the tests to Nitrolinks so we can narrow Pondo’s\ntest concerns.\nThe Plan\nJust to recap, here is the plan:\n\nMove Nitrolinks out into its own gem ✔\nCreate tests within Nitrolinks that mirror tests in Pondo\nRemove Nitrolinks-specific tests out of Pondo\nRewrite Nitrolinks in ES6\n\nWe are going to do Step 2.\nPrepping\nFirst we need to make sure that we can run tests on the nitrolinks rails engine.\nBecause I manually built the gem using Bundler’s tutorial, I ended up with some\npretty bare-bones rails engine code. That’s a good thing. In practice, we don’t\nwant to burden ourselves with extra code we might need in the future but is\nuseless now.\nYet we do need some other things now that we want to make our engine testable.\nWhat we need specifically is a dummy app we can use to plug our engine into so\nwe can run the test scenarios. Luckily, rails already provides a tool for this\nwith the rails plugin new generator.\nRunning the command on the parent of our root directory:\n\n…will add new files and folders to the engine directory. Some of them we need\nwhile others we’ll have to clean up.\nHere’s what it looks like now after cleaning things up:\n\nMoving Tests\nThese were written as cucumber specs and they work quite well for testing the\nend-user features. They do make it slow to run the tests. In the future, we’ll\nfigure out a way to use mainly javascript tests for these and concern ourselves\nwith engine-related specs for this engine.\nFirst, we’ll need to copy all of the pondo specs related to nitrolinks  to the\nengine. This is a significant undertaking that it’ll probably fill this whole\npost with just to describe everything. I’ll just point out the most important\nchanges I did.\nGemfile\n\nTo use cucumber, I had to add cucumber-rails and other test dependencies to\nthe Gemfile itself. I wish I didn’t have to but just adding this on the gemspec\nas a development dependency doesn’t work. We also probably don’t need the\n:development group here and just leave all of them to the :test group. I’ll\nremove that in the future.\nIn hindsight, it might have been better if I just used rspec with capybara and\nthat would have solved a lot of these problems. But I haven’t tried it on a\nrails engine and the feature specs have already been written anyway so we’ll\nuse cucumber for now.\nbin/rails\n\nI had to add a bin/rails script file so that cucumber will know where the\ndummy application is. After that, I run the cucumber install task for cucumber.\n\nFeature Specs\nThe rest of what I did was just making sure the feature specs copied from pondo\nwould run and removing traces of pondo from the code. That meant a lot of\nrenames and clean up. I’ll have to do a thorough sweep next time in case I\nmissed anything.\nHere is the change commit.\nWhat does our specs look now?\n\nAnd that’s it. We now have a well-tested rails engine. That took more effort\nthan I anticipated but it’s well worth it.\n","id":"https://brainchildprojects.com/posts/refactoring-nitrolinks-part-2-tests-for-a-rails-engine/","title":"Refactoring Nitrolinks, Part 2: Tests for a Rails Engine"},"https://brainchildprojects.com/posts/refactoring-nitrolinks-part-3-pondo-cleanup/":{"body":"This is Part 3 of a series of posts about refactoring\nNitrolinks\nout of Pondo.

Let’s use that\nin pondo.\n\nLet’s do a test run to make sure everything is green.\n\nGreat! We’re in a good place now.\nCleanup\nNext we’ll remove nitrolinks feature specs.\n\nHow are we on the specs?\n\nThat reduced our scenario count from 29 to 15 and our steps from 148 to 93. Next\nlet’s remove the nitrolinks step definitions and check our specs again.\n\n\nGood we’re still green. Next we’ll edit our pages helper and step definitions to\nremove any trace of nitrolinks.\n\n\n\nWe’re still green! This is getting a little repetetive so we’ll finish up with\nsome more code cleanups by removing any unnecessary references to nitrolinks.\nThat includes routes, controllers, and views related to just nitrolinks testing.\nAfter all that, you know what’s coming…\n\nWe’re in a good place right now so let’s commit our code first. Here’s\neverything we’ve done so far.\nFearless Refactoring\nYou’ll notice that for every significant change we do, we always run the specs\nto ensure we haven’t introduced regressions. This is what great test coverage\nenables. We can remove code and refactor without fear. If we make a mistake,\nwe get feedback on where it happened and what went wrong.\nIntroducing tests adds a lot of upfront cost to a project but it is all worth\nit. That upfront cost will payoff sooner than you think.\nIt’s important to note that great test coverage alone is not enough. We also\nneed to make sure that we are testing correctly and that our tests are fast\nenough to encourage us to run them frequently.\nConstraints in Testing Nitro Apps\nThere is still some nitro-specific thing we’re doing in Pondo and it starts\nhere:\n\n…and used here:\n\nBecause nitrolinks overrides the navigation behavior by fetching the page\nthrough xhr, there’s no way for Capybara to know to wait for a new page load.\nThis code allows us to tell Capybara to wait until the page has been loaded.\nIt’s a clunky hack but it serves us for now.\nThe problem is that this really ought to be in Nitrolinks. We have to let\nnitrolinks handle this and provide a way for clients of the gem to use this\nfeature in their tests.\nWe’ve duplicated this code on Nitrolinks. Let’s move it to the lib so we can\nrequrie it from Pondo.\n\nLet’s also move that jscript method into another module:\n\nTo use, we’ll only need to add this on pondo:\n\nWe’ll also refactor out the loading-related code into a separate script:\n\nOn the pondo side, we’ll just require it on our testing javascript:\n\nBumping our nitrolinks-rails gem version and including it in Pondo, everything\nworks as expected.

You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nh4. Heading\nContent is stored in text files that contain two sections.

It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to.
